# How to Play

A multiplayer word bluffing game

## 🎮 Setup

1. **Host a Game:** One player creates a new game and receives a 6-digit game code
2. **Join:** Other players join using:
   - The game code on the "Join Game" screen
   - A shareable link (click "🔗 Link" to copy and share)
   - QR code (click "📱 QR" to show/share)
3. **Dictionary Holder:** The host assigns a "Dictionary Holder" who manages each round (can be any player)

## 🔄 Round Flow

### 1. Setup Phase (Dictionary Holder)
- Select a difficulty level: Kids (8-12), Teens, or Adults
- Choose an obscure word (use "Random" button or enter manually)
- Enter or fetch the real definition from online dictionaries
- Start the round to begin collecting definitions

### 2. Definition Phase (All Other Players)
- See the word
- Submit a fake definition that sounds plausible
- Try to fool other players into thinking your definition is real

### 3. Voting Phase (All Players except Dictionary Holder)
- See all fake definitions plus the real definition (shuffled randomly)
- Vote for the definition you think is real
- Cannot vote for your own definition

### 4. Results Phase
- Reveals which definition was real
- Shows who wrote each fake definition
- Displays vote counts and points earned
- Host starts the next round

## 🏆 Scoring

Points are awarded at the end of each round:

- **+1 point per vote** - Players earn 1 point for each vote their fake definition receives
- **+1 point for guessing correctly** - Players who vote for the real definition earn 1 point
- **+1 point per correct vote** - The Dictionary Holder earns 1 point for each player who votes for the real definition
- **+1 bonus point** - The host can award bonus points to players who provide exceptionally clever or accurate definitions (awarded manually during results)

## 💡 Strategy Tips

- Write convincing fake definitions that sound like dictionary entries
- Use proper grammar and formal language to match real definitions
- Balance being believable with being creative
- Get close to the real definition to potentially earn bonus points from the host
- Vote for the real definition to earn points
